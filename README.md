# P6_Robot_Driver
This repository consist of the code based used in our Bachelor project. 
In short the project goal, was to design a robot following controller, using a Raspberry Pi 4, a Camera and a Distance Sensor. 

## Camera_Detection
The object detection utilizes a trained deep learning model optimized for lightweight computers, aiming to achieve a higher framerate.

## LiDAR 
This module incorporates LiDAR technology for accurate distance measurement and obstacle detection. It enhances the robot's navigation capabilities by providing precise environmental data.

## ROS_Packages 
This module integrates various ROS (Robot Operating System) packages to facilitate communication between different components of the system. ROS enables modular development and simplifies the implementation of complex robot behaviors.
